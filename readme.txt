This plugin prevents users from commenting or viewing your website if a comment of theirs has been marked as spam.

== Description ==
If you are tired of blocking spammers' IP addresses manually, you can use this plugin. It blocks all visitors who posted a comment that was later **marked as spam** or prevents them from posting comments. For example if your Akismet catches a spam comment, its author will be muted/blocked until you delete the spammer's IP address from your database.

= Features =
* Advanced tools for managing banned IP addresses
* Simple tool for importing and exporting records
* Automatic banning of spammy IP addresses
* Automatic removing of spam comments
* Configurable banned message
* Two ways of detecting spammers
* Two ways of restricting access to spammers

**No more mess!** All plugin data will be automatically removed from your database after you delete the plugin.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin, extract and upload it to your plugins folder on your server.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Configure the plugin (Settings â†’ Spammer Blocker)

8. Tool for deleting old records

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where does the plugin store its data in my MySQL database? =
SB stores banned IP addresses in a table called "wp_sb_ip_log". Plugin's settings can be found in the table "wp_options":

* sb_plugin_version
* sb_detection_of_spammers_method
* sb_detection_of_spammers_time
* sb_banned_message
* sb_automatic_ip_address_duplication
* sb_automatic_ip_address_duplication_recurrence
* sb_automatic_ip_address_duplication_last_cron_run_time
* sb_spam_comment_automatic_elimination
* sb_access_restrictions

= What should I do if I accidentally marked my own comment as spam and the plugin has blocked my IP address? =
Delete your IP address from the table "wp_sb_ip_log" in your MySQL database.

= What should I do if there is a spammer who has a cookie and is still able to post comments even if I marked the comments as spam? =
Wait until spammer's cookie expires or use the slow method of detection of spammers. When the spammer visits your blog again, their cookie will be deleted.

= What happens if I add the same IP address more than once? =
Nothing. Duplicate records are automatically filtered.

= I got an error when I finished updating the plugin. =
Uninstall and install the plugin again. I try to avoid all errors that may be caused by updating to a newer version, but nobody is perfect, so this might help in the case that I forgot to prepare something for an update (typically new names of the plugin's options in the wp_options table in the MySQL database).

= Are IPv6 addresses supported? =
No. (That may change in the future.)

= I have another problem that is not described on this page or the forum. =
Post a new thread on the forum.
